Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - A weakness or bulge of the main artery in the abdomen.
Anaerobic Threshold - The point at which your muscles start to burn more oxygen than your heart and lungs can deliver. The higher the number the better as this reflects the functional capacity of your heart, lungs and circulation. However, it is also a very good measure of the work that your muscles can do and in fit individuals should be above 40% of your peak oxygen uptake.
Aneurysm - Abnormal weakening of the wall of an artery causing a “ballooning” appearance, enlarging to over twice normal size.
Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) - A non-invasive method for testing for peripheral arterial disease through the use of a Doppler probe and a blood pressure cuff on both the arms and ankles. Ideally these two blood pressures should be equal. An ABPI of greater than 1.0 is considered normal.
Aorta - Main blood vessel in the chest and abdomen that transports blood from the heart.
Artery - Artery is a blood vessel carrying oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body. When
diseased, the organ supplied may become damaged due to lack of oxygen and nutrients.
Atherosclerosis - From the Greek words athero (gruel or paste) and sclerosis (hardness). The process within the arteries where deposits of fatty substances, cholesterol, calcium or fibrin are built up in the inner lining (called plaques). A normal consequence of aging where the arterial walls gradually thicken and arterial fibres decline. The arteries become stiff.
Calcified vessels - When an artery becomes hardened from calcium deposits in the wall. Often seen in diabetes. Affects the ability to make accurate pressure measurements in the legs.
CardioPulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) – Maximal exertion test which gives an all encompassing overview of how your heart and lungs are working. It is used for objective fitness testing in elite athletes, in healthcare for stratifying risk before major surgery and can even predict life expectancy.
Carotid artery - The carotid artery is the major artery providing blood flow to the brain from the heart. It is located in the front of the neck. Carotid artery disease may develop when sufficient plaque development builds up in the neck. This can break free from the artery (embolism) and travel upstream to the brain, potentially causing a stroke.
Cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) - Lack of blood supply to the part of the brain, which can cause loss of speech, blindness, paralysis or weakness.
Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) - A disease in the veins that causes leg swelling, pain and varicose veins.
Claudication - Occurs because a blocked artery is interfering with the amount of oxygen-rich blood that can reach the muscles in one or both of the arms or legs, resulting in cramps or fatigue with exercise.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Clotting within the vein caused from an injury, immobility or abnormal clotting factors. Usually in the leg.
Doppler Ultrasound - A Doppler ultrasound study is usually part of a vascular ultrasound examination. It is a specialised technique that uses low intensity ultrasound to visualise and detect blood flow velocity in arteries and veins.
Duplex - diagnostic tool that combines Doppler and ultrasound.
ECG Rhythm - This describes the electrical activity controlling the heart beat.
Femoral artery - The large artery in the leg ,which extends from hip to knee. Often the bypass grafts start at this point.
Heart rate - This is the speed at which your heart beats. When you exercise your heart rate should be able to get to within 80% of its maximum predicted rate (220 minus your age).
O2 Pulse at Peak Exercise and Overall Waveform - This is a functional measure of your ‘stroke
volume’. This is the volume of blood your heart pumps each beat. As you exercise this should increase demonstrating the normal heart’s ability to increase its output to your working muscles. At peak exercise it should be above 10mls/beat.
Peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2,ml/kg/min) - the maximum level of oxygen that you can take from the atmosphere and consume as fuel for your muscles. This is a measure of heart and lung function. It’s an excellent indicator of fitness, predicts life expectancy and is what elite athletes use to measure their peak performance.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) - A common disorder that occurs in the artery segments of the circulatory system (legs, pelvis, neck, brain). The artery wall linings slowly become narrowed by irregular clots formed due to build up of cholesterol or plaque. It has major implications on a patient’s life due to association with blockages in the heart and brain with potential for death from heart attack and stroke.
Popliteal artery - The artery behind the knee that supplies blood to the lower leg.
Pulmonary (lung) reserve - how much of your lung function you have in reserve, normally this should be more than 30%. Your lungs have a vast capacity and even when you are exercising at your maximum you normally don’t need to use more than 70% of this.
ST Changes - The ‘ST segment’ of the ECG becomes abnormal if the relevant part of the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen, usually due to coronary artery disease.
Stenosis - A narrowing of a blood vessel, such as artery or vein.
Stroke - When blood flow to a part of the brain is stopped, even briefly. Symptoms can be numbness or weakness of the arms or legs, sudden changes in vision or loss of vision in one eye, slurring of words, or facial droop.
Subclavian artery - Artery that branches off of the aorta in the chest and supplies blood to the arm.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA) - A brief disturbance in vision described as "blurring" or "a curtain over the
eye" that clears in several seconds to minutes. This is typically caused by plaque dislodgment.
Thrombosis - Blockage in an artery or vein.
Ultrasound - Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive medical test that helps vascular scientists diagnose and
vascular surgeons to treat medical conditions.
Ultrasound is safe and painless, and produces images of the inside of the body using sound waves. Ultrasound imaging involves the use of a small transducer (probe) and ultrasound gel placed directly
on the skin. High-frequency sound waves are transmitted from the probe through the gel into the body. The transducer collects the sounds that bounce back and a computer then uses those sound waves to create an image. Ultrasound examinations do not use ionizing radiation (as used in x-rays), thus there is no radiation exposure to the patient. Because ultrasound images are captured in real-time, they can show the blood flowing through blood vessels.
Vascular Ultrasound - Vascular ultrasound uses sound waves to evaluate the body’s circulatory system and help identify blockages or measure the size of the arteries. Vascular ultrasound is the diagnostic test for peripheral arterial disease that produces images of arteries or veins on a screen via the use of ultrasound equipment.
Ventilatory Equivalent for CO2 (VECO2) at Anaerobic Threshold - This marker is an indicator of the efficiency of your lung to process air. The lower the number, the better the efficiency. At rest, your lung doesn’t need to be efficient as it is not stressed, so this number is higher. As you exercise you become more efficient so the number drops until the heart and circulation cannot deliver enough oxygen after which your lungs become less efficient again. This number should be below 30 at anaerobic threshold.
Vessels - The tube-like structures in the circulatory system that are responsible for circulating blood within the body. The three kinds of vessels are arteries, veins and lymphatics. Capillaries are the microscopic structures that connect arteries and veins at the tissues.
Vertebral artery - An artery in the back of the neck providing additional blood flow to the brain. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency may develop when these blood vessels are significantly blocked due to atherosclerosis or plaque formation. The symptoms that develop from this insufficient blood flow may mimic a stroke.
Vein - Blood vessels that carry the blood from the body back to the heart.
Work - the level of energy that you can produce.
Above knee amputation (AKA) - is also known asatransfemoralamputation.This is an operation where the leg is removed above the knee andinvolves removing the knee, calf and footby cutting through both the thigh tissue and femoral bone.
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) - Activated  partial  thromboplastin time (APTT)is a blood coagulation test where the normal range is approximately 27-35seconds.  Adequate  heparinization  is  achieved  if  the  APTT  is  extended  to  90-120seconds with an APTT ratio in the range 2.5-3.5.APTT may be falsely elevated in patients with lupus anticoagulant (antiphospholipid syndrome). 
Angioplasty - Angioplasty  is  any  procedure  designed  to  increase  the  diameter  of  a narrow or stenosed artery. Although previously referring to the surgicalinsertion of a patch in to the artery wall at the site of thenarrowing, this terms now predominantly refers  to  transluminal  angioplasty  where  a  high-pressure  balloon  catheter  is  passed through the narrowing and then inflated under pressure crushing atherosclerotic disease and frequently rupturing the rigid atherosclerotic inner layer of the artery,allowing the artery to expandwidening the lumen. More recently still, angioplasty is frequently accompanied by stenting (see below).
Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) - Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is a simplemeasure of the ankle arterial pressure using a hand-held Doppler ultrasound.  The ankle arterial pressure is normally equal to or higher than the brachial pressure in the arm giving an ABPI of >1.0.  This pressure is frequently in the range 1.0 -1.2.  A pressure  below  0.8  is  considered  abnormal,  although  pressures  of  0.9  may  also  be abnormal.    An  exercise  challenge  may  be  appropriate  to  detect  arterial  stenosis  in patients with a normal or near-normal ABPI.
Arterial thrombosis - Arterial  thrombosis  is  a  thrombusforming  within  an  artery, usually on arterial disease. The most common varieties of arterial thrombosis occurwhen arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis finally thrombose due to adherent platelets and fibrin. This usually causesischaemia (an in-adequate blood supply) to the tissues supplied  by  that  artery.  Examples  are  coronary  thrombosis  causing  myocardial infarction  (heart  attack)  or  carotid  or  cerebrovascular  thrombosis  causing  a  stroke. Arterial thrombosis is also a frequent cause of angina (pain in the heart muscle on exercise), intermittent claudication (pain in a leg muscle on exercise) and ischaemia of the  leg,which  may  require  arterial  reconstruction  or  amputation.  If  an  arterial thrombosis embolises, it will usually only embolise to the distal small arteries,causing ischaemia of the tissues supplied by those arteries.
Artery - An artery is arelatively thick-walled blood vessel that conducts blood away from the heart and towards the body’s tissues.  The blood pressure within arteries is high and pulsatile as the arterial system absorbs each cardiac contraction and distributes high pressure blood around the body.  The largest artery is the aorta which conducts the blood from the left heart to the rest of the body with arteries serving all the limbs and organs progressively branching to smaller arteries with arterioles supplying capillaries which perfuse the tissue.
Atherosclerosis - Atherosclerosis depictsa degenerativedisease  of  arteries  that develops usually in the elderly and which has been described in lay terms as “hardening of the arteries”. The first features occurwhen lipids,such as cholesterol,enter the lining of the artery wall andcause fatty streaks,which may be seen as early as teenage years. Thisresultsin an inflammatory process that producesatherosclerotic plaques,which may  grow  to  sufficient  size  that  the  centre  of  the  plaque  liquefies.  Large  or circumferential atherosclerotic plaques may cause a stenosis (see below) disturbing blood flow and causing both thrombosis and embolism. Atherosclerotic plaques may rupture,discharging atherosclerotic debris into the arterial blood causing embolisation to  distal  tissues.  Plaque  rupture  is  one  of  the  mechanisms  that  may  lead  to  acute thrombosis of a diseased artery. This can result in myocardial infarction (heart attack) in the coronary arteries, stroke in the arteries to the brainor tissue ischaemia anywhere in the body.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) - Atrial fibrillationis a cardiac condition causing an irregular and frequently rapid heartbeat. The normal right atrial pacemaker fails to dominate the heart rate and the atrium almost continuously contracts with erratic electrical signals causing the ventricles to contract at an irregular and rapid rate. The failure of normal contraction in the left atrium may result in thrombus formation in the atrial appendage (left  auricle).  This  thrombus  may  detach  and  embolise  into the  arterial  circulation,causing a stroke if it enters the cerebral circulation,or obstructing branches of the aorta (most frequently the arteries to the leg).
Below knee amputation (BKA) - Also known asatranstibialamputation, below knee amputation  (BKA)is  an  operation  where  the  leg  is  removed  below  the  knee  andinvolves removing the foot, ankle joint, and distal tibia and fibula with related soft tissue structures.
Cellulitis - Cellulitis describesan acute inflammatory response involving the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  Most frequently this is due to a spreading infection:  Typically a Streptococcus.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue swells, is oedematous, red or pink, hot and tender.  The patient usually has a temperature.  The treatment is high elevation and intravenous antibiotics when the cause is infection.  Cellulitis may also be caused by prolonged dependency in patients with obesity or venous disease and by superficial thrombophlebitis (thrombosis of superficial or varicose veins).
Claudication (intermittent claudication) -  Claudicationis  derived  from  the  Greek claudicarae,which means to limp. The symptom describes ischaemic pain (pain due to an inadequate blood supply) in the leg musclesduring exercise, such as walking. When the  arteries  supplying  the  leg  are  narrowed  or  occluded,  sufficient  blood  may  pass through  the  artery  or  collaterals  (smaller  blood  vessels  generally  passing  through muscles) to supply the needs of the tissue when at rest. On exercise, musclesrequire a ten-fold increase in blood supply,which cannot be met when the main artery is blocked or narrowed.The muscle then develops cramping painduring exertion,analogous to angina in the heart,which is relieved by rest. Following a short rest, the individual can usually walk a similar distance again hence intermittentclaudication.
Compartment Syndrome - Compartment syndrome describes a painful and serious condition that results due to increased pressure within a fixed anatomical space. Muscle ischaemia occurs when vessels become compressed therefore restricting blood flowto the area. The most frequent compartment involved is the anterior tibial compartment in the lower leg where the boundaries are the tibia,medially, interosseousmembrane and the fibula posteriorly and a thick deep fascial sheath covering the calf anterolaterally. Wherever  muscle  is  confined  within  a  strong,  fibrous,  deep  fascia  compartment syndromes may occursuch as thelower leg and forearm. Typically, severe swelling of the  muscle  following  an  episode  of  ischaemia  results  in  high  pressures  within  the confined compartment which prevent venous return and aggravate the severity of the swelling.  Ultimately,  the  pressure  within  the  compartment  rises  to  alevel  that  it prevents any circulation to the involved muscles, which become severely ischaemic and ultimately dies (necrosis). If detected early enough, dividing the deep fascia over the compartment  relieves  the  pressure  and  allows  the  muscle  to  recover (fasciotomy). When a fasciotomy is required in a limb it is usual to release the pressure in all the relevant muscle compartments (3 compartments in the lower leg and 2 compartments in the forearm). 
Cyanosis -  Cyanosis is ablue discolouration of the skin due to deoxygenated blood in the circulation. Peripheral cyanosis may occur when the circulation is sluggish and the tissues extract much of the available oxygen fromblood as it circulates through the hands and feet. Central cyanosis, affecting the lips and tongue, indicates that the arterial blood is relatively desaturated and that there is a serious problem affectingthe function of  the  heart  or  the  lungs.  Central  cyanosis  may  occur  when  there  is  venous  blood passing directly into the arterial circulation through a “hole in the heart”, but may also occur when the function of the lungs is impaired by a pulmonary embolus or by severe lung disease.
Diabetes mellitus - Type  I (T1DM) Develops in childhood and almost invariably requires insulin therapy, due to the body’s inability to produce its own insulin. Quality of  life  and  life  expectancy  heavily  depend  of  the  quality  of  diabetic  control  and maintaining stable, reasonably low blood glucose levels. Diabetic small artery disease with  retinopathy(damage  to  the  eyes),  nephropathy(damage  to  the  kidneys)and peripheral neuropathy(damage to the peripheral nerves)becomes inevitable in young or mid adult life with few type I diabetics achieving the age of 50.  Diabetic control may  be  substantially  improved  by  pancreatic  transplantation  (sometimes  combined with renal transplantation) and implantable insulin pumps are being developed. The combination of peripheral neuropathy with small artery disease renders these patients prone to foot ulceration in mid-life and major limb amputation in the age range 40-55 years.
Doppler ultrasound - Ultrasound is reflected off moving red cells in blood creating a Doppler signal which changes in pitch according to the velocity of blood flow.  Hand-held Doppler is frequently used to detect flow in the arteries of the foot or wrist in order to measure the ankle arterial pressure.  Hand-held Doppler is also useful in the detection of  reversed  flow  in  varicose  veins.  Doppler  may  be  combined  with  grayscale ultrasound  in  the  more  detailed  assessment  of  arteries  and  veins  (see  Duplex Ultrasound). 
Duplex ultrasound   (duplex   Doppler   ultrasound   or   colour   Doppler): This instrument  combines  greyscale  ultrasound  imaging  of  the  soft  tissues  with  colour-Doppler imaging of blood flow within vessels.  Greyscale ultrasound clearly depicts fluid-filled cavities such as blood vessels or cysts.  The vessel wall at right angles to the ultrasound signal reflects ultrasound clearly providing a sharp image.  Blood flow, and the direction of that flow, within the artery or vein is displayed in colour allowing rapid assessment of arteries and veins in the neck or limbs.  A cursor can be placed within the vessel lumen measuring the flow velocity which is the best indication on the haemodynamic significance of a stenosis (narrowing in the artery or vein).
Embolectomy -  This is a procedure in which thrombus or embolus areremoved through an arteriotomy (an incision into the artery).  The most frequent embolito be removed are(i) saddle embolus of the aortic bifurcation; (ii) embolus ofthe common femoral bifurcation; and (iii) embolus of the brachial artery where it bifurcates into the ulnar and radial arteries. Emboli usually arisefrom the heart andaredue to either a previous myocardial  infarction  or  atrial  fibrillation.  The  embolectomy  is  usually  performed through an incision over the blocked arteryand an arteriotomy ofthe artery allowsa catheter with a balloon at the end to be passed up and down thearteries.The balloon canthenbe inflated and pulled down extracting emboli and any secondary thrombus through the arteriotomy.  Theprocedure is then repeated until good downflow from above and backflow of blood from below is achieved. Closure of the arteriotomy then allows the circulation to the limb to be restored. Emboli -  These are particles of atherosclerosis, thrombus or other material that pass within the arterial or venous circulation. This embolic material may obstruct branches of an artery impairing the blood supply of any of the organs or tissues supplied by that artery.
Embolism - The lodging of a material (emboli) within a vessel, resulting in partial or complete  blockage  of  blood  flow. Venous  thrombi  normally  embolise  to  the  lungs (pulmonary embolism)whereas arterial thrombimay embolise to any organ or tissue in the body.
Embolisation - The process by which an embolus is formed. The formation of many emboli may cause organ damage. Fasciotomy -  A surgical procedure involving the division of the deep fascia over a muscle compartment where there is compartment syndrome or a risk of compartment syndrome developing. This procedure usually involves incising the skin and deep fascia over the entire length of the relevant muscle compartment. The most frequent muscle compartments requiring this procedure are the anterior and lateral compartments in the calf or all the muscle compartments of the calf. Fasciotomy is often required for the thigh and the forearm but may also be required for the hand or foot. These full-length incisions often need treatment with skin grafts for healing to occur and obvious scarring is inevitable.
Femoral  artery - The  main  artery  in  the  thigh  that  supplies  the  lower  limb  with oxygenated blood. Blood from the heart passes throughthe aorta,which divides into the common iliac arteries in the abdomen. These then branch into the external iliac artery that passesunder  the  inguinal  ligament  in  the  groin  to  become  the  common femoral artery.The common femoral arteryis a large artery 6-8mmin diameter but only 2-3cm long.  It divides into the profunda (deep) femoral artery thatsupplies the thighand the superficial femoral artery thatpasses through the thigh to supply the lower legs.  It is only 2cm deep to the skin in normal individuals and easily accessible for surgery.
Femoral embolectomy - mbolectomy is a procedure in which thrombus or embolus areremoved through an arteriotomy (an incision into the artery).  The most frequent embolus to be removed is a saddle embolus of the aortic bifurcation or an embolus ofthe common femoral bifurcation, whicharisesfrom the heart andaredue to either a previous  myocardial  infarction  or  atrial  fibrillation.  The  embolectomy  is  usually performed through a vertical incision in the groin and an arteriotomy ofthe femoral artery allowsa catheter with a balloon at the end to be passed up the iliac arteries into the aorta.The balloon canthenbe inflated and pulled down extracting emboli and any secondary thrombus through the arteriotomy.  Theprocedure is then repeated in the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries until good downflow from above and backflow of blood from below is achieved. Closure of the arteriotomy then allows the circulation to the limb to be restored. 
Gangrene -  Necrosis of tissue,which may be due to ischaemia, infection, pressure or a number of other causes. In ischaemia, the gangrene tends to remain dry with the tissue shrivelling and turning black (dry gangrene).
Heparin- Heparin  is  an  anticoagulant  that  cannot  be  given  orally  but  when administered intravenously achieves immediate and effective anticoagulation by acting at the end of the coagulation cascade.  Unfractionated Heparins also had variable effects on different patients and have now largely been replaced by low molecular weight Heparin fractions which can be administered subcutaneously in a dosage based on the patient’s  weight.When  immediate  urgent  anticoagulation  is  required,  intravenous unfractionated Heparin is still given.
Hypertension - High blood pressure.
Hypotension - Low blood pressure.
Infarction - This occurs when a tissue, anorgan or part of an organ dies due to impaired blood supply. Itis a common cause of death in myocardial infarction (heart attack) or cerebral  infarction  (stroke).  Infarction  may  occur  due  to  high  pressures  within  a confined  space  (compartment  syndrome)  or  due  to  severe  venous  hypertension following Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or may result from strangulation of the gut within a hernia.
Ischaemia - Impaired blood supply to a tissue or organ.  Usually, this is due to arterial disease in an artery of supply. Ischaemia may also follow thrombosis, embolism or dissection in artery of supply.  It may also occur when a tissue (usually the gut) becomes trapped, such as in a hernia, so that the venous drainage is impaired. Ischaemia may occur due to compression (compartment syndrome) and due to a wide range of other causes.  Severe ischaemia results in death of the tissue (necrosis) typically ischaemia causes severe pain such as in heart attack and loss of function of the involved tissues (paralysis or loss of sensation in a limb or stroke).
Necrosis - Necrosis described the death of tissue from whatever cause.  Frequently this is due to an impaired blood supply although pressure, infection and trauma are other common causes.  (See infarction).
Oedema - This  simply  describes  swelling  of  the  tissues  due to  excessive  fluid.  Typically, this occurs in the legs due to high vein pressures or heart failure.  When unilateral, this suggests venous or lymphatic disease in the relevant limb.
Oral anticoagulation - This is an oral therapy to reduce the tendency of blood to clot. Anticoagulation, commonly, although not strictly accurately,referred to as thinning of the blood,may be achieved by Heparin, given intravenously or subcutaneously,or by oral  drugs  such  asWarfarinor  DOACs.The  dose  of  Warfarin  required  to  achieve anticoagulation  varies betweenindividuals.  This  is  monitoredand  controlled  byregularlymeasuring the anticoagulant effect, using a blood test.
Paraesthesia -  This is an abnormal sensation experienced by the patient, typically a tingling or prickling sensation, although it can be described as ‘pins and needles’. It is caused primarily by pressure or damage to peripheral nerves.   
Perfusion -  The  adequacy  of  the  circulation  to  any  tissue  may  be  described  as  the perfusion of that tissue. Inadequate tissue perfusion will result in symptomsand when the perfusion is inadequate at rest the result is ischaemia.Tissue perfusion may be impaired  by  disease  of  the  proximal  arteries,  thrombosis  in  the  proximal  arteries, embolisation  into  the  arteries  supplying  that  tissue,  pressure  within  a  hernia  or  in compartment syndrome and occasionally by severe venous obstruction.
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) -  This is a common condition where a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts the blood supply to the leg muscles. It's also known as  peripheral  vascular  disease  (PVD).Many  people  with  PAD  have  no  symptoms. However, some develop a painful ache in their legs when they walk, which usually disappearsafter  a  few  minutes'  rest.  The  medical  term  for  this  is  "intermittent claudication". The pain can range from mild to severe, and usually goes away after a few minutes when you rest your legs. More severe symptoms include skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue deathwhich may require amputation.
Perfusion -  The  adequacy  of  the  circulation  to  any  tissue  may  be  described  as  the perfusion of that tissue.  Inadequate tissue perfusion will result in symptoms.  When the perfusion is inadequate at rest the result is ischaemia.  Tissue perfusion may be impaired by disease of the proximal arteries, thrombosis in the proximal arteries, embolisation into  the  arteries  supplying  that  tissue,  pressure  within  a  hernia  or  in  compartment syndrome and occasionally by severe venous obstruction.
Peripheral neuropathy - This describes any condition involving the peripheral nerves that affects their function. This condition is most frequently seen in diabetic patients, whereit tends to affect the sensation in theirfeet. As a result,increased pressure and soft tissue damage can occur without the patient realising. Classically,this results in deep ulcers over bony high-points on the foot. This condition is aggravated by diabetic small artery disease which is thought to impair the blood supply to the peripheral nerves and  make  ulceration  more  likely  in  the  foot.  The  impaired  circulation alsoinhibits healing of these ulcers,which frequently progress or remain chronic.
Phantom limb pain - A pain, often severe, experienced in the amputated part of a limb. Most frequently experienced in the leg where a severe sharp or burning pain may be felt to involve the toes or foot of a leg that has been amputated. This pain is notoriously difficult to treat. The severity of the pain is known to relate to the duration of the pain in that limb prior to amputation.
Popliteal artery - Anarterylocatedbehind the knee that passes through the popliteal fossa between the adductor canal in the thigh and the soleal arch in the upper calf. It conductsblood from the superficial femoral artery in the thigh to the arteries in the calf.Also presentare the superiorand inferior geniculate arteries that may act as collaterals. The popliteal artery maybe injured in supracondylar fractures of the femur. Popliteal artery aneurysmsmay develop in older men.
Sepsis - Describes a bacterial infection associated with an inflammatory reaction. It should be distinguished from sepsis syndrome, which is a severe inflammatory reaction that may be caused by a number of serious illnesses. Typically, a bacterial infection resulting  in  sepsis  causes  fever,  rigors  or  shaking  episodes  associated  with  chills, malaise and a high white cell count and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures may indicate bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream) or septicaemia (bacteria multiplying in the blood stream usually caused by severe sepsis). 
Stenosis - A narrowing of a hollow tube or viscus. Typically used to describe narrowing of an artery due to atherosclerotic disease that is sufficient enough to influence the flow of blood.
Thrombolysis - This is where a thrombus or blood clot is dissolved using naturally occurring  substances  that result  inthe  breakdown  of the thrombus.  The  two  most common agents used are streptokinase and, more recently, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Both these agents increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead toseriousadverse effectssuch  as  cerebral  haemorrhage  causing  stroke.  Streptokinase  may  cause  an allergic reaction. Thrombolysis tends to be effective in recent thrombus and is rarely effective when a thrombus has been present for more than one month. It is highly effective at clearing large vessels, but largely ineffective in small vessels in the foot or hand. The thrombolytic agent must be administered into the bloodstream or using a catheter directly into the thrombus.
Thrombosis - Thrombosis  describes  the  process  in  which  blood  clots,  or  forms  a thrombus, within arteries or veins. Arterial thrombosis is usually firm white material derived predominately from blood cells such as platelets with adherent fibrin. Venous thrombosis is frequently nothing other than soft clotted blood due to venous stasis or injury to the vein wall. A thrombus that detaches from the artery or vein may then move in the blood circulation is described as an embolus.
Vein bypass - This is where a vein, usually the long saphenous vein from the leg, is used to bypass a blocked artery. Most frequently this is the superficial femoral artery in the thigh,when it is occluded by atherosclerosis. Vein bypasses are also used following traumatic division or thrombosis of any artery of the appropriate size. Typically, the vein is reversed so that the valves do not inhibit flow,although with insitu bypasses the vein may be left in its bed and the valves everted using an intra-lumenal instrument. Vein is the optimal material for bypass (as opposed to a prosthetic) but there is a risk of vein graft stenosis, occlusion by thrombosis and of atherosclerosis developing within the vein graft over many years.
